. Set up directory structure - library ApprovalTestsQt
. Mirror sub-directory of main project
. Decide on namespace to use - ApprovalTestsQt
. Create QImageWriter class - takes const QImage& - actually, need to avoid nameclass - see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qimagewriter.html
    . Maybe use QImageApprovalWriter
. Create QImageApprovalComparator - and make it compare images optionally ignoring tiny differences
. Set up documentation
. Think about how to compare QWidget objects
. Think about integration with Qt Test framework

. Work out to get GUI environment and display on Travis CI builds on Linux for Clang 5 and 6
