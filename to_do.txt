. Set up directory structure - library and tests
. Mirror sub-directory of main project
. Decide on test framework to use
. Decide on namespace to use
. Work out how to incorporate main ApprovalTests.cpp project in to this - and its 3rd-party dependencies - to avoid duplication
    . Possible example: https://gitlab.rotate-it.be/tripled/guilded-rose-kata/commit/c503bf8a2b772881184b6ddbb3cd660b1e1be2ea
. Create QImageWriter class - takes const QImage& - actually, need to avoid nameclass - see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qimagewriter.html
    . Maybe use QImageApprovalWriter
. Create QImageApprovalComparator - and make it compare images optionally ignoring tiny differences
. Set up documentation
. Think about how to compare QWidget objects
. Think about integration with Qt Test framework
. Set up CI builds
