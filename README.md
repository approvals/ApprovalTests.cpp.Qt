# ApprovalTests.cpp.Qt

Coming soon...

## Usage

There is not yet a single-header release mechanism, so the individual headers in the ApprovalTestsQt directory need to be included.

## Benefits

* The Catch integration creates a QApplication automatically, so that GUI tests can run.

## Reference

### Setting up your main

<!-- snippet: catch_2_qt_main -->
<a id='snippet-catch_2_qt_main'/></a>
```cpp
// main.cpp:
#define APPROVALS_CATCH_QT
#include "ApprovalTestsQt/integrations/catch/Catch2QtApprovals.h"
```
<sup>[snippet source](/tests/Catch2_Tests/main.cpp#L1-L5) / [anchor](#snippet-catch_2_qt_main)</sup>
